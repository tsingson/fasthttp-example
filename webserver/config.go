	// By default keep-alive connections are enabled.

	// Per-connection buffer size for requests' reading.
	// This also limits the maximum header size.

	//
	// Default buffer size is used if not set.

	//
	// Default buffer size is used if not set.

	// ReadTimeout is the amount of time allowed to read
	// the full request including body. The connection's read
	// deadline is reset when the connection opens, or for
	// keep-alive connections after the first byte has been read.
	//
	// By default request read timeout is unlimited.
	ReadTimeout time.Duration

	// WriteTimeout is the maximum duration before timing out
	// writes of the response. It is reset after the request handler
	// has returned.
	//
	// By default response write timeout is unlimited.
	WriteTimeout time.Duration

	// IdleTimeout is the maximum amount of time to wait for the
	// next request when keep-alive is enabled. If IdleTimeout
	// is zero, the value of ReadTimeout is used.
	IdleTimeout time.Duration

	// Maximum number of concurrent client connections allowed per IP.

	// By default unlimited number of concurrent connections
	// may be established to the server from a single IP address.
	MaxConnsPerIP int

	// Maximum number of requests served per connection.
	//
	// The server closes connection after the last request.

	//
	// By default unlimited number of requests may be served per connection.
	MaxRequestsPerConn int

	// MaxKeepaliveDuration is a no-op and only left here for backwards compatibility.
	// Deprecated: Use IdleTimeout instead.
	MaxKeepaliveDuration time.Duration

	// Whether to enable tcp keep-alive connections.
	//
	// Whether the operating system should send tcp keep-alive messages on the tcp connection.
	//
	// By default tcp keep-alive connections are disabled.
	TCPKeepalive bool

	// Period between tcp keep-alive messages.
	//
	// TCP keep-alive period is determined by operation system by default.
	TCPKeepalivePeriod time.Duration

	// Maximum request body size.
	//
	// The server rejects requests with bodies exceeding this limit.
	//
	// Request body size is limited by DefaultMaxRequestBodySize by default.
	MaxRequestBodySize int

	// Aggressively reduces memory usage at the cost of higher CPU usage
	// if set to true.
	//
	// Try enabling this option only if the server consumes too much memory
	// serving mostly idle keep-alive connections. This may reduce memory
	// usage by more than 50%.
	//
	// Aggressive memory usage reduction is disabled by default.
	ReduceMemoryUsage bool

	// Rejects all non-GET requests if set to true.
	//
	// This option is useful as anti-DoS protection for servers
	// accepting only GET requests. The request size is limited
	// by ReadBufferSize if GetOnly is set.
	//
	// Server accepts all the requests by default.
	GetOnly bool

	// Logs all errors, including the most frequent
	// 'connection reset by peer', 'broken pipe' and 'connection timeout'

	// clients.
	//
	// By default the most frequent errors such as
	// 'connection reset by peer', 'broken pipe' and 'connection timeout'
	// are suppressed in order to limit output log traffic.
	LogAllErrors bool

	// Header names are passed as-is without normalization
	// if this option is set.
	//
	// Disabled header names' normalization may be useful only for proxying
	// incoming requests to other servers expecting case-sensitive
	// header names. See https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp/issues/57
	// for details.
	//
	// By default request and response header names are normalized, i.e.
	// The first letter and the first letters following dashes
	// are uppercased, while all the other letters are lowercased.
	// Examples:
	//
	//     * HOST -> Host
	//     * content-type -> Content-Type
	//     * cONTENT-lenGTH -> Content-Length
	DisableHeaderNamesNormalizing bool

	// to be excluded from the Response.
	//
	// The default Server header value is the value of the Name field or an
	// internal default value in its absence. With this option set to true,
	// the only time a Server header will be sent is if a non-zero length
	// value is explicitly provided during a request.
	NoDefaultServerHeader bool

	// header to be excluded from the Response.

	NoDefaultContentType bool

	// KeepHijackedConns is an opt-in disable of connection
	// close by fasthttp after connections' HijackHandler returns.
